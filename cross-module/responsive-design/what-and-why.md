# Responsive Design

>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.

Smashing Magazine, 2011

notes: The term has roots in responsive architecture, experimental building design that **responds** automatically to people and their behaviour. This link, and the term, first proposed by Ethan Marcotte (2009).

# Mobile First

>It is the principle that designers should use to provide the best user experience for mobile first, then continually build up to much larger screens such as iPad, and eventually desktop.

>But responsive Web design is not only about adjustable screen resolutions and automatically resizable images, but rather about a whole new way of thinking about design.
