### Overview

Coursework 1 will see you tackle the specification and design of a web-based interactive story. You will produce an interactive prototype which you will use for testing your design. You will also submit documentation that details what your story is and does, your testing results, and justification for your design choices.

The submission deadline for this work is midday (12pm) on Friday 2nd December. You are encouraged to seek feedback from your lab tutor throughout the first semester on your ongoing work.

This design and specification can form the basis of what you produce for Coursework 2, so this is a great opportunity to get some thorough feedback before moving onto production for the second coursework.

### Where to Start?

Your first job is to decide what your story is going to be. Although you are going to carry this design forward into Coursework 2, you can make changes between the two based on the feedback you’ll get, so don’t feel you’ve got to commit to something that will satisfy CW2 right now.

However, there are a number of points that your story must satisfy:

- Uses or presents audio and/or video content
- Animates the user interface
- Is accessible
- Is mobile-first and adapts to desktop

If you’re stuck for an idea, you’ll find some suggestions at the end of this brief, so feel free to use one of them.

### What to Submit

Your final submission will be a written report and your interactive prototype.

The report should contain:

- An introduction - what is your story
- A specification - a detailed list of the things it should do/be
- Initial design sketches of the mobile view with commentary
- Your final mobile designs with commentary
- Some sketches and commentary on how it will adapt to desktop
- User feedback based on your prototype
- Details of any changes made based on feedback
- Conclusion - how successfully does this design meet the specification you set

Through this, your report should cover:

- the steps you will take to ensure your app is accessible
- why you have made the choices you’ve made

Your report will be submitted through Turnitin. If you do not submit through Turnitin, your report will not be marked.

Your report should be 1000 words plus imagery.

You will also be submitting an interactive prototype. The URL to access this should be clearly included in your report. This should be the prototype for the mobile version of your story. It should demonstrate story structure and functionality as much as the prototyping platform allows.

### Marking Criteria

There are five marking criteria, each worth an equal 20% of the total coursework mark.

#### Accessibility

This is concerned with the degree to which to make sure your story is as accessible as possible to all, regardless of physical or mental impairments. This should be discussed in your report, justifying aspects of your design in terms of their accessibility.

| Mark Range             | Requirement                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Excellent (70+)        | Prototype shows a design that takes all necessary steps to ensure accessibility. The report discusses these measures, identifying why they have been taken.          |
| Good (50 - 69)         | Prototype shows a design that takes most necessary steps to ensure accessibility. Your documentation discusses these measures, identifying why they have been taken. |
| Satisfactory (40 - 49) | Prototype shows a design that takes some necessary steps to ensure accessibility. Documentation discusses these broadly.                                             |
| Poor (0 - 39)          | Prototype shows little or no steps taken to ensure accessibility. There is little to no mention of accessibility in the documentation.                               |

#### Responsiveness

This is concerned with the degree to which to make sure your app adapts to the screen size it is being used on.

| Mark Range             | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Excellent (70+)        | The report discusses clear differences between the desktop and mobile versions, with the advantages and limitations of each clearly accepted. It discusses these choices and why they have been made, with reference to external sources where appropriate.                                         |
| Good (50 - 69)         | The report shows that a moderate amount of effort has gone in to working with each screen size. This is mostly successful, though there are some minor issues. It discusses these well showing a good grasp of responsive design.                                                                   |
| Satisfactory (40 - 49) | The report shows that there is some difference between the two versions, though there is at least one major issue, such as a single column not expanding into a grid on desktop. The documentation shows an awareness of the principles of responsive design and provides some commentary on the choices made. |
| Poor (0 - 39)          | The report fails to discuss responsive design, or at most does so poorly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Critical Analysis

This is concerned with your testing and evaluation of your prototype.

| Mark Range             | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Excellent (70+)        | Testing includes well structured and justified feedback on your prototype from a number of users. The report discusses and justifies your testing methodology. The commentary reflects on this feedback, critically evaluating the design with reference to both the specification and the current state of the art. |
| Good (50 - 69)         | Testing includes some feedback from a number of users, with some discussion of the testing methodology. The commentary reflects on this feedback and makes reference to the app specification.                                                                                                                       |
| Satisfactory (40 - 49) | Testing includes some feedback from users. The report critically evaluates the app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Poor (0 - 39)          | There is no feedback from users and any evaluative commentary is shallow and inconclusive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Design Process

This is concerned with the process of designing your app, from initial idea and sketches through to final design.

| Mark Range             | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Excellent (70+)        | Report demonstrates a clear, informed, and thorough design process that remains focussed on the specification. Design developments are well justified and evaluated, with the final design being the result of several iterations. The prototype is consistent with the final designs. |
| Good (50 - 69)         | Report clearly shows the design process, informed by the specification. Design developments are justified and evaluated. There are at least initial sketches prior to the final designs. The prototype is mostly consistent with the final design.                                     |
| Satisfactory (40 - 49) | Report shows the design process, informed by the specification. Design developments are justified. There are at least initial sketches prior to the final design. There are a number of inconsistencies between the final design and the prototype.                                    |
| Poor (0 - 39)          | Report shows little or no evidence of a design process. Any developments that are included have no justification or evaluation. There are either no sketches, or they are so general and rudimentary as to be pointless.                                                               |

#### Presentation

This is concerned with the presentation of both your prototype and the report.

| Mark Range             | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Excellent (70+)        | The prototype matches the final designs, all links and transitions work. The report is properly formatted, excellently written, and free from any spelling or grammar issues. All referencing is proper and complete.                                  |
| Good (50 - 69)         | The protoype mostly matches the final designs, most links and transitions work. The commentary is intelligible. The report is properly formatted, well written, and has only minor spelling or grammar issues. All referencing is proper and complete. |
| Satisfactory (40 - 49) | The prototype mostly matches the final design, most links work. The report is properly formatted, though there may be issues with language, spelling, or grammar.                                                                                      |
| Poor (0 - 39)          | The prototype is unfinished or rudimentary. Links and transitions don't work. The report is difficult to read.                                                                                                                                         |

### Example Story Ideas

Here are a few examples of what you could do. You can use one of these ideas as a start point as it is, or simply for inspiration to get you going.

**A choose-your-own-adventure story**

Allow the reader to make choices through the course of the story that change the trajectory of the story. This will require careful planning of the options they will have along the way in order to try to avoid dead ends. 

**A story with interactive elements**

A linear story where some visual elements respond to interaction from the reader. For example, a simple children's story where a butterfly flaps its wings when tapped or clicked. 

**A murder mystery**

Similar to the choose-your-own-adventure structure, where the reader navigates their own path through the story, uncovering evidence as they do so. The conclusion sees them having to decide who they think did the deed.

**A documentary story**

You could tell a real life story, such as the history of a football club or a crime case. You could intersplice real footage into your design along the way.
