## Four Principles for Good Design

* Proximity
* Alignment
* Repetition
* Contrast



# Proximity

Group related elements to form a cohesive whole  
Don't be afraid of white space  
Create a visual hierarchy  
Makes a layout easier to read  



# Alignment  

Shows visual connection between elements  
Creates order, and therefore calm  
Aids readability  
Use strong vertical lines of alignment  
Align text with images  



# Repetition  

Repeat aspects of the design throughout  
Creates consistency  
Allows the reader to 'learn' your layout  



# Contrast  

If two items are not the same, make it obvious  
Adds visual interest to the page  
Helps the reader to seperate content  
Use typeface, size, colour, spacing, textures, shapes ...
