## Welcome to Multimedia II
I hope you enjoy studying this module through your second year and find that you learn many valuable skills from it. It is a modern reality that many creative disciplines can be enhanced with at least a working knowledge of how the web works. An incredible amount of content is now delivered over the Internet, from short form videos to full blockbusters, from amateur audio clips to platinum albums, images, radio, applications and more. Whether you’re a videographer, sound engineer, animator or editor, an understanding of the web should be a key component of your skillset.

Throughout the module please get in touch if you have anything to say on the content or the way we teach it. We’re very open to comments, good and bad, that will help to shape and improve the module. Similarly, if you’re having problems keeping up or don’t understand a particular concept, please get in touch as soon as possible and we’ll be able to help you more easily.

## Module Description

This module will build on your work last year in TECH1015 and develop your understanding of media presentation using the Internet. Last year was concerned with getting the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as some of the mechanics of the Internet. Through the course of this module you’ll develop a more nuanced approach that will consider the needs of different users consuming your media through a range of platforms.

You will build on your technical understanding of the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these languages you will investigate issues of layout, style, animation, and interactivity, all with a keen focus on the user and the user experience. You will also make use of existing online resources, particularly those that can manage your media productions such as Vimeo and SoundCloud.

Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research in to the software and practices we undertake. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.

## Blackboard – Virtual Learning Environment

This module makes use of Blackboard – De Montfort University’s Virtual Learning Environment. It is important that you access Blackboard regularly to keep up to date with:

* Assessments
* Lab activities
* Lecture notes
* Your assessment feedback
* General notices and announcements
* Lecture recordings

Access to Blackboard can be found at:

<https://www.blackboard.dmu.ac.uk>

<a name="plagiarism"></a>
## Plagiarism

DMU defines plagiarism as “the deliberate attempt to gain advantage by presenting any work, data or concepts (including drafts and work in progress) that are not the student’s own as if they were”. The University takes a very serious stance against copying other people’s work without giving the proper credit.

You can read more about plagiarism and other acedemic offences in Chapter 4 of the student regulations: <https://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/dmu-students/academic-support-office/student-regulations/chapter-4-17.18.pdf>

If you use somebody else’s work, either as research or directly, always attribute the author/artist/musician etc in the proper way. In this module we use the Harvard Referencing style. Directions on the use of the Harvard referencing system can be found through the library website: <http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Images/Selfstudy/Harvard.pdf>

If you are found to of copied work without crediting the source you are likely to face a disciplinary panel and could see your mark reduced to 0, or worse in extreme cases.

If you have any questions regarding plagiarism and other academic practice offences, you can email either of the Leicester Media School's Academic Practice Officers:  
Simon Walsh <simon.walsh@dmu.ac.uk>  
Helen Ackerley <hackerley@dmu.ac.uk>

<a name='assessment'></a>
## Assessment

You will be assessed continuously through the module with formal feedback given at two key points through the year as well as informally in labs. The full details of coursework 1 and 2 follows this brief overview.

### Coursework 1  
Worth 40% of the module total, your first coursework will see you produce an individual piece of work. This will involve specifying and designing a web app, including producing a prototype,  testing, and getting feedback from users.

### Coursework 2  
Worth 60% of the module total this coursework will tackle HTML5 and other web technologies to have you produce the website or application you designed for Coursework1.

### Some notes on assessment submissions

All written submissions (i.e. reports and documentation) should be submitted through Turnitin. You will find a link to submit your report through the Assessment section on Blackboard.

You will be required to create a logical folder structure on your public server to which you will upload your practical work for marking. Follow the instructions for structure and naming exactly, and don’t put anything there that shouldn’t be marked. If your tutor is in any doubt as to where your work is, it may not get marked.

Make sure the names of all files on your public server include only letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens. No spaces, no slashes!

If you are unsure about any details of an assessment, ask your lab tutor.

To reiterate:

All written work through Turnitin  
All practical work uploaded to your public server space

### Overview

Coursework 1 will see you tackle the specification and design of a media-driven web app. You will produce an interactive prototype which you will use for testing your design. You will also submit documentation that details what your web app is and does, your testing results, and justification for your design choices.  

The submission deadline for this work is midday (12pm) on Friday 13th December. You are encouraged to seek feedback from your lab tutor throughout the first semester on your ongoing work.

This design and specification can form the basis of what you produce for Coursework 2, so this is a great opportunity to get some thorough feedback before moving onto production for the second coursework.


### Where to Start?

Your first job is to decide what your app is going to be. Although you are going to carry this design forward into Coursework 2, you can make changes between the two based on the feedback you’ll get, so don’t feel you’ve got to commit to something that will satisfy CW2 right now.

However, there are a number of points that your app must satisfy:

* Uses or presents audio and/or video content  
* Animates the user interface  
* Is accessible  
* Is mobile-first and adapts to desktop  
* Contains four pages, or is equivalent.

If you’re stuck for an idea, you’ll find some suggestions at the end of this brief, so feel free to use one of them.  


### What to Submit

Your final submission will be a written report and your interactive prototype.

The report should contain:

* An introduction - what is your app  
* A specification - a detailed list of the things it should do/be
* Initial design sketches with commentary  
* Your final designs with commentary  
* User feedback based on your prototype  
* Details of any changes made based on feedback  
* Conclusion - how successfully does this design meet the specification you set  

Where there is a requirement for commentary, make sure to include

* details of steps you will take to ensure your app is accessible  
* how the interface changes/adapts to screen size  
* why you have made the choices you’ve made  

Your report will be submitted through Turnitin. If you do not submit through Turnitin, your report will not be marked.

Your report should be 1000 words plus imagery.

Your will also be submitting an interactive prototype. The URL to access this should be clearly included in your report. This should be the prototype for the mobile version of your website. It should demonstrate website structure and functionality as much as the prototyping platform allows.  

### Marking Criteria

There are five marking criteria, each worth an equal 20% of the total coursework mark.

#### Accessibility
This is concerned with the degree to which to make sure your app is as accessible as possible to all, regardless of physical or mental impairments.

|Mark Range| Requirement                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
|Excellent (70+) |Prototype shows a design that takes all necessary steps to ensure accessibility. The report discusses these measures, identifying why they have been taken.|
|Good (50 - 69)  |Prototype shows a design that takes most necessary steps to ensure accessibility. Your documentation discusses these measures, identifying why they have been taken. |
|Satisfactory (40 - 49) | Prototype shows a design that takes some necessary steps to ensure accessibility. Documentation discusses these broadly.|
|Poor (0 - 39)   |Prototype shows little or no steps taken to ensure accessibility. There is little to no mention of accessibility in the documentation.|

#### Responsiveness  
This is concerned with the degree to which to make sure your app adapts to the screen size it is being used on.

|Mark Range| Requirement                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
|Excellent (70+) |The report discusses clear differences between the desktop and mobile versions, with the advantages and limitations of each clearly accepted. It discusses these choices and why they have been made, with reference to external sources where appropriate. |
|Good (50 - 69)  |The report shows that a moderate amount of effort has gone in to working with each screen size. This is mostly successful, though there are some minor issues. It discusses these well showing a good grasp of responsive design.|
|Satisfactory (40 - 49) | The report shows that there is some difference between the two versions, though there is at least one major issue, such as a single column not expanding into a grid. The documentation shows an awareness of the principles of responsive design and provides some commentary on the choices made. |
|Poor (0 - 39)   | The report fails to discuss responsive design, or at most does so poorly. |


#### Critical Analysis
This is concerned with your testing and evaluation of your prototype.

|Mark Range| Requirement                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
|Excellent (70+) |Testing includes well structured and justified feedback on your prototype from a number of users. The report discusses and justifies your testing methodology. The commentary reflects on this feedback, critically evaluating the design with reference to both the specification and the current state of the art.|
|Good (50 - 69)  |Testing includes some feedback from a number of users, with some discussion of the testing methodology. The commentary reflects on this feedback and makes reference to the app specification. |
|Satisfactory (40 - 49) | Testing includes some feedback from users. The report critically evaluates the app. |
|Poor (0 - 39)   |There is no feedback from users and any evaluative commentary is shallow and inconclusive.  |

#### Design Process  
This is concerned with the process of designing your app, from initial idea and sketches through to final design.

|Mark Range| Requirement                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
|Excellent (70+) |Report demonstrates a clear, informed, and thorough design process that remains focussed on the specification. Design developments are well justified and evaluated, with the final design being the result of several iterations. The prototype is consistent with the final designs.|
|Good (50 - 69)  |Report clearly shows the design process, informed by the specification. Design developments are justified and evaluated. There are at least initial sketches prior to the final designs. The prototype is mostly consistent with the final design.  |
|Satisfactory (40 - 49) | Report shows the design process, informed by the specification. Design developments are justified. There are at least initial sketches prior to the final design. There are a number of inconsistencies between the final design and the prototype.|
|Poor (0 - 39)   |Report shows little or no evidence of a design process. Any developments that are included have no justification or evaluation. There are either no sketches, or they are so general and rudimentary as to be pointless.  |

#### Presentation
This is concerned with the presentation of both your prototype and the report.

|Mark Range| Requirement                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
|Excellent (70+) |The prototype matches the final designs, all links and transitions work. The report is properly formatted, excellently written, and free from any spelling or grammar issues. All referencing is proper and complete.|
|Good (50 - 69)  |The protoype mostly matches the final designs, most links and transitions work. The commentary is intelligible. The report is properly formatted, well written, and has only minor spelling or grammar issues. All referencing is proper and complete. |
|Satisfactory (40 - 49) | The prototype mostly matches the final design, most links work. The report is properly formatted, though there may be issues with language, spelling, or grammar. |
|Poor (0 - 39)   |The prototype is unfinished or rudimentary. Links and transitions don't work. The report is difficult to read.|

### Example App Ideas

Here are a few examples of what you could do. You can use one of these ideas as a start point as it is, or simply for inspiration to get you going.

#### A Single-Page Website
Multiple sections combine into a single long vertical-scrolling page. As the user scrolls down, new sections are introduced through a combination of background (colour, shape, image) and foreground (text, graphics) animations. A menu provides direct access to each section.

#### Online Gallary
A grid of thumbnails presents a range of artwork. Click on one and you can see it full size, alongside notes such as the artist, medium, date etc. The thumbnails in the grid are resizeable - when they're made larger, you get less in a row - they rearrange. The grid is filterable: the user selects to just show photography, everything else disappears and the grid rearranges.

#### A Personalised Story
The user enters their name and other details on page 1, before being presented with a simple interactive story that incorporates these details. Animations mark the transition between scenes and the introduction of text and graphics within them.

### Overview
In semester 1 you designed and prototyped a modern web app or website. For this coursework you will go on to produce it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You will first make any modifications to the design that you think are necessary following feedback from your tutor and peers. You will then let loose your webdev skills in realising your dream design.

As well as your practical work, you will also submit a report documenting your updated design, production work, and evaluation of your finished project.

But what if you don't want to use your design from Coursework 1? That's fine, your tutor can provide you with a prototype on which to base your work, just as if it was done for the previous coursework.

Some key points to consider:

* Make sure to pay attention to the marking criteria. A good mark for Coursework 1 doesn't automatically translate to a website that hits all the criteria for coursework 2 - you may need to adapt your design
* Don't skimp on the testing - this is critically important and **will** get you a better mark.
* Stick to your (updated) design. If you need to differ from it, make sure to discuss this in your report.


Any content that is not yours (images, music, sound effects, etc.) should be appropriately referenced at a minimum in a list in the documentation (note that Google, or other search engines are not sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may effect your grade. This does not prevent you from getting your colleagues or tutor to criticise early drafts of your work before it is handed in / published.

Any content you produce for your website such as an audio interview will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. For example, a video that is stored at a much larger size than it is displayed at would be a no no. You have other modules where you are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output. Speak to your tutor if you have any questions about this.

There are two main components to this coursework: the website itself and a portfolio of associated documentation. The website attracts 60% of the mark for this coursework, and the documentation 40%.

### Documentation.
**Weighting:** 40% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Word Count:** 1300 words, plus appropriate screenshots.

Your documentation should consist of the following components.

#### Overview of Designs
**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark

You should include your designs, whether updated or not. These should be accompanied by a commentary that addresses:

* what was strong about your design
* what has changed and why   
* where you think your main challenge(s) might be - and a fallback plan  
* what you consider to be the priority feature(s) of your design

This should be written in light of your own evaluation of your design from CW1, your peer feedback, and your tutor feedback.
