## Welcome to Multimedia II

I hope you enjoy studying this module through your second year and find that you learn many valuable skills from it. It is a modern reality that many creative disciplines can be enhanced with at least a working knowledge of how the web works. An incredible amount of content is now delivered over the Internet, from short form videos to full blockbusters, from amateur audio clips to platinum albums, images, radio, applications and more. Whether you’re a videographer, sound engineer, animator or editor, an understanding of the web should be a key component of your skillset.

Throughout the module please get in touch if you have anything to say on the content or the way we teach it. We’re very open to comments, good and bad, that will help to shape and improve the module. Similarly, if you’re having problems keeping up or don’t understand a particular concept, please get in touch as soon as possible and we’ll be able to help you more easily.

## Module Description

This module will build on your work last year in TECH1015 and develop your understanding of media presentation using the Internet. Last year was concerned with getting the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as some of the mechanics of the Internet. Through the course of this module you’ll develop a more nuanced approach that will consider the needs of different users consuming your media through a range of platforms.

You will build on your technical understanding of the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these languages you will investigate issues of layout, style, animation, and interactivity, all with a keen focus on the user and the user experience. You will also make use of existing online resources, particularly those that can manage your media productions such as Vimeo and SoundCloud.

Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research in to the software and practices we undertake. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.

<a name='how'></a>

## How the Module Works

This module is delivered through a weekly series of lectures and practical lab sessions. They are both on Fridays. 

### Lecture Sessions

We will have a one-hour lecture each week. These will be used to discuss issues such as design and accessibility, as well as engage in collaborative practical tasks to help explain and demonstrate key concepts as we move through the module. 

### Practical Lab Sessions

The practical lab sessions will follow directly after the lecture each week. These will be an opportunity for you to practice your skills in producing interactive experiences on the web, with ongoing support from your lab tutor. 

### Learning Materials

The lecture sessions will be recorded and made available to you via DMU Replay for review within a few days of the lecture. These might provide helpful reminders.

In addition, we have a collection of short-form practical videos and explainers that step through key tasks and concepts when coding for the web. These will be linked to as they become appropriate, though you're more than welcome to browse the whole catalogue. 

In the labs, you'll be working through set tasks, with an opportunity for comment, help, and review by your lab tutor. 

You should also make use of the reading list, linked from the Blackboard Shell, to find sources of information that could help you master particular concepts along the way.

<a name="plagiarism"></a>

## Plagiarism

DMU defines plagiarism as “the deliberate attempt to gain advantage by presenting any work, data or concepts (including drafts and work in progress) that are not the student’s own as if they were”. The University takes a very serious stance against copying other people’s work without giving the proper credit.

You can read more about plagiarism and other acedemic offences in Chapter 4 of the student regulations: <https://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/dmu-students/academic-support-office/student-regulations/chapter-4-17.18.pdf>

If you use somebody else’s work, either as research or directly, always attribute the author/artist/musician etc in the proper way. In this module we use the Harvard Referencing style. Directions on the use of the Harvard referencing system can be found through the library website: <http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Images/Selfstudy/Harvard.pdf>

If you are found to of copied work without crediting the source you are likely to face a disciplinary panel and could see your mark reduced to 0, or worse in extreme cases.

If you have any questions regarding plagiarism and other academic practice offences, you can email the Leicester Media School's Academic Practice Officer:  
Helen Ackerley <hackerley@dmu.ac.uk>

<a name='assessment'></a>

## Assessment

You will be assessed continuously through the module with formal feedback given at two key points through the year as well as informally in labs. The full details of coursework 1 and 2 follows this brief overview.

### Coursework 1

Worth 40% of the module total, your first coursework will see you produce an individual piece of work. This will involve specifying and designing an interactive experience to be delivered via the web, including producing a prototype, testing, and getting feedback from users.

### Coursework 2

Worth 60% of the module total this coursework will tackle HTML5 and other web technologies to have you produce the interactive experience you designed for Coursework 1.

### Some notes on assessment submissions

All written submissions (i.e. reports and documentation) should be submitted through Turnitin. You will find a link to submit your report through the Assessment section on Blackboard.

You will be required to create a logical folder structure on your public server to which you will upload your practical work for marking. Follow the instructions for structure and naming exactly, and don’t put anything there that shouldn’t be marked. If your tutor is in any doubt as to where your work is, it may not get marked.

Make sure the names of all files on your public server include only letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens. No spaces, no slashes!

If you are unsure about any details of an assessment, ask your lab tutor.

To reiterate:

All written work through Turnitin  
All practical work uploaded to your public server space

## Coursework 1

Coursework 1 will see you tackle the specification and design of a web-based interactive story. You will produce an interactive prototype which you will use for testing your design. You will also submit documentation that details what your story is and does, your testing results, and justification for your design choices.

The submission deadline for this work is midday (12pm) on Friday 2nd December. You are encouraged to seek feedback from your lab tutor throughout the first semester on your ongoing work.

This design and specification can form the basis of what you produce for Coursework 2, so this is a great opportunity to get some thorough feedback before moving onto production for the second coursework.

You can find the full coursework brief, including the marking criteria, here: <a href="https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader.html?TECH2015-CW1-Brief">https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader.html?TECH2015-CW1-Brief</a>

## Coursework 2

For Coursework 1 you designed and prototyped a web-based interactive story. For this coursework you will go on to produce it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You will first make any modifications to the design that you think are necessary following feedback from your tutor and peers. You will then let loose your webdev skills in realising your dream design.

As well as your practical work, you will also submit a report documenting any changes to your designs and an evaluation of your finished project.
