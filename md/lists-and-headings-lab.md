# Lists and headings

Now it's time to build a little on the simple page you've started.

You're going to do two things:

1. Add a list to your page
2. Add subheadings


## 1. Add a List

Lists in HTML come in two flavours, ordered and unordered. Ordered lists are numbered (or lettered) and created using an `<ol>` element. Unordered lists are bulleted lists and created with a `<ul>` element.

<div class="todo">
Add an ordered list to your page that lists the top three reasons dogs have decided to work for the bank.
</div>

By default, ordered lists are numbered, but they can also have letters or Roman numerals (in upper and lowercase).

Have a look at entry on W3Schools for the `<ol>` element: <https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp>

<div class="todo">
Can you change your list to use Roman numerals instead?
</div>

## 2. Add Subheadings

You've now got a some content building up on this page, getting to the point where subheadings would be useful for the reader. Subheadings help to add structure to your page.

The list you just created for example could do with a subheading. So far, you've just got the main heading at the top with the `<h1>` element. A subheading for this list should therefore use a `<h2>` element.

<div class="todo">
Use a `<h2>` to add a subheading to the list.
</div>

HTML provides six levels of heading, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

Let's add some more content to see more of how headings work.

<div class="todo">
Copy the following content after your list.
</div>

> **Businesses Suited to Animal Employees**
>
> Many businesses could benefit from embracing our feathered and furry friends in the workplace.
>
> **Cafes**
>
> Perhaps you've been to a cat cafe already? Relax with a coffee and be soothed by the elegant slow dance and soft purring of some feline friends.
>
> **Hospitals**
>
> Hospitals often have a need to move small things like sample tubes and paperwork to other parts of the hospital quickly, often along long narrow corridors. Parrots would be perfectly suited to this role, and would also help brighten things up, adding a little cheer for those enjoying a temporary stay.
>
> **Window Cleaning**
>
> If window cleaners used Pelicans to hold their water, instead of carrying a bucket up a ladder, it's estimated that 356 window cleaning injuries a year could be avoided. They're also good company on a lunch break.

The bold items are headings. Mark them up with suitable headings tags. Hint: this should use both `<h2>` and `<h3>` elements.

## That's a Wrap

And that's it. Make sure to load your page in the browser to see how it looks, on both desktop and mobile sizes.  
Now you know how HTML works, how to create a simple page, and how to start adding structure to it.
