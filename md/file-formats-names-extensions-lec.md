# File Extensions
* Websites are comprised of files <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
* The browser needs to know exactly what those files are <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
* It does that using the file extension <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

___

# File Names

File names actually have two parts.

<span class="fragment fade-in">teddy</span><span class="fragment fade-in">.jpg</span>  
<span class="fragment fade-in">week2</span><span class="fragment fade-in">.html</span>  
<span class="fragment fade-in">saturday</span><span class="fragment fade-in">.mp4</span>  

Every file has an extension, but the operating system doesn't usually show it to you.<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

___

___

# Text
We are concerned with two types of text file:  

* html 
* css

---

# HTML = Data Representation

HTML describes the content and its structure with text.

What do we mean by content and structure?

Lets look at an example 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page>

---

# To Recap
* We need to be explicit with the computer
* We need to make media choices carefully
* HTML = content and its structure

# Any Questions?
