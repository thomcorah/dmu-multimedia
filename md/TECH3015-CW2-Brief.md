## Overview

In semester 1 you designed and prototyped a web-based interactive story. For this coursework you will go on to produce it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You will first make any modifications to the design that you think are necessary following feedback from your tutor and peers. You will then let loose your webdev skills in realising your dream design.

As well as your practical work, you will also submit a report documenting any changes to your designs and an evaluation of your finished project.

But what if you don't want to use your design from Coursework 1? That's fine, speak to your tutor about developing a proposal for a different idea.

Some key points to consider:

- Make sure to pay attention to the marking criteria. A good mark for Coursework 1 doesn't automatically translate to an interactive story that hits all the criteria for coursework 2 - you may need to adapt your design
- Don't skimp on the testing - this is critically important and **will** get you a better mark.
- Stick to your (updated) design. If you need to differ from it, make sure to discuss this in your report.

Any content that is not yours (images, music, sound effects, etc.) should be appropriately referenced at a minimum in a list in the documentation (note that Google, or other search engines are not sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may effect your grade. This does not prevent you from getting your colleagues or tutor to criticise early drafts of your work before it is handed in / published.

Any content you produce for your story such as an audio interview will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. For example, a video that is stored at a much larger size than it is displayed at would be a no no. You have other modules where you are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output. Speak to your tutor if you have any questions about this.

You are expected to heavily comment your HTML, CSS, and JS code. These comments should show an understanding of how the code functions, and discuss any alternative approaches that were discounted. For the purposes of marking, these comments will be included in the mark for documentation.

There are two main components to this coursework: the interactive story itself and the documentation. The story attracts 60% of the mark for this coursework, and the documentation 40%.

### Submitting your coursework

**When completed, you are required to submit your coursework as follows:**

- Your **report** as a PDF, through the Turnitin link in the Assessments section of the TECH3015 Blackboard page ([see deliverables below](#deliverables))
- Your **story** should be in your GitHub repository — name the landing page 'index.html'. Your tutor should be added as a contributor on this repository. Make sure you have GitHub Pages turned on in order that your story is publically viewable through a web browser. 

## CW2 Marking Criteria

This coursework is formed of two components. Your web-based interactive story and your supporting documentation. 

### Practical Work - Your Interactive Story (Total 60% of CW 2)

Your practical work **must** be available on your public server, and will be assessed against three criteria:
- Content  
- Style  
- Technical Skills

### Content

**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark 

Your story content should be fully functional and robust (valid HTML, no missing images, JavaScript errors, etc.). This includes all text, graphics, images and any audio/video. You should use the correct HTML5 code to display these and ensure you have prepared your media for the web.

- HTML5 markup uses semantic tags appropriately
- Text content has semantic structure e.g. headings, lists
- Careful selection, preparation and editing of video and/or audio
- Awareness of loading speed and disk space e.g. no huge images
- Your own original content is credited and any third-party content referenced (media from a single source can have just a single general credit/reference)

### Style

**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark  

Your story should appeal to your intended audience and be consistent with your mockups/designs. You should make efficient and effective use of CSS in order to style and position elements for your story.

- Style and layout reflect/have evolved from design
- Coherent overall design (following PARC principles), colour and font choices
- Design and content matches the target audience
- Skillful use of CSS to style and arrange web elements
- No duplicate CSS, classes instead of IDs for selectors
- Well-ordered CSS: mobile-first followed by `min-width` breakpoints to be fully responsive at any screen width


### Technical Skills

**Weighting:** 30% of the coursework mark  

Your interactive story should demonstrate your ability to apply the technical concepts you have learnt in this module.

- Evidence of your ability to choose and code current web markup, style and programming
- Awareness of usability/accessibility (semantic HTML5 tags, image “alt” attributes, other considerations)
- Use of CSS animations and transitions (subtle or otherwise!)
- No broken links or missing media, site is consistent across mobile and larger platforms
- Use of at least two of:
  _ Local database storage
  _ Third-party APIs
  _ CSS Animation
  _ JavaScript user interaction and/or functionality

### Documentation (Total 40% of CW 2)

**Word Count:** 1000-1500 words with images. References, appendices, and code comments are not included in the word count.

The report must document your updated design (if modified), explain your media preparation, and make a critical evaluation of your finished project — what worked, what could be improved, explanations of decisions you made along the way, and how you might want to take the work further in future.

Make notes and screenshots during the process of creating your story, so you can simply edit these before you submit the report rather than trying to remember your process retrospectively.

If you don't want to use your design or topic from Coursework 1, explain how and why you have readjusted your plans.

Note that the for the purposes of marking, your code comments will be considered as part of your documentation, specifically under the production section. The PDF you submit through Turnitin should contain your Design Process and Evaluation. Your documentation will be marked against the following three criteria.

### Design Process

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark  

Refer back to your mock-ups from assignment 1 and discuss:

- what has changed and why
- what you think your main challenge(s) were
- what you consider to be the most important feature(s) of your design

This should be written in light of your own evaluation of your design from CW1, with your peer and tutor feedback.

### Production

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark

Offer some insight into the development of your website through extensive code comments. All of your code should be commented at a basic level to describe functionality and logic. Where applicable, you should also discuss:

- What you were trying to achieve
- How you did this
- Why you chose a certain approach
- How successful the outcome was

### Evaluation

**Weighting:** 20% of the coursework mark

Address the following points:

- Evidence of code testing (e.g. all links work, media loads, the site is consistent across browsers) and the HTML has been validated.
- Evidence and a breakdown of structured user testing and feedback.
- Evaluate your work, with reference to testing where appropriate, and user feedback, describing:
  - Any limitations of your website
  - Any improvements you would make to the site and why
  - Any problems you encountered along the way, referencing any solutions you found or devised


### Key points to consider:

- Examine CW2 marking criteria closely. A good mark for Coursework 1 doesn't automatically translate to a story that meets the criteria for Coursework 2 - you may need to adapt your design or prototype
- Don't skimp on **user testing** - this is critically important and **will** get you a better mark
- [validate your HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) (this is crucial) and at least run your [CSS through a validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), and [check for accessibility issues](https://wave.webaim.org/) (although these can be advisory) and briefly document this process
- **Reference any content** that’s not yours (images, music, sounds, online tutorial code not included in the learning materials etc.) e.g. in a list or appendix in the documentation (note: Google or other search engines themselves are _not_ primary sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may effect your grade.
- **Prepare your media**: content such as audio interviews, videos, images will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. Prepare media for quick download and/or streaming on the web, and demonstrate your knowledge of this requirement. Other modules are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output, so you can speak to your relevant tutor about this.

### Where to Start?

- think about how your designs will translate into code, especially the main blocks of content
- [validate your HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) at each major stage and fix any errors early—don't allow any broken code!
- start a document to make notes about your process and decisions
- get a basic responsive and mobile-fist structure up and running that follows your design
- upload to GitHub as you go along and get some feedback from testers

### Deliverables

1. the interactive story, in your GitHub repository
2. your critical report, in PDF format, via Turnitin

### Commenting Your Code

You should add comments to your HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with explanations of what your code does. These comments will demonstrate your understanding of your code and the reasons you took the approaches you did.
