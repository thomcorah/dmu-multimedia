## Welcome to Multimedia III

I hope you enjoy studying this module through your final year and find that you learn many valuable skills from it. It is a modern reality that many creative disciplines can be enhanced with at least a working knowledge of how the web works. An incredible amount of content is now delivered over the Internet, from short form videos to full blockbusters, from amateur audio clips to platinum albums, images, radio, applications and more. Whether you’re a videographer, sound engineer, animator or editor, an understanding of the web should be a key component of your skillset.

In this module we will use web technologies and combine them with creative storytelling to produce original interactive content for the web. Through this, you will expand your skills in creative coding, using the web as a platform for creative ideas. 

Throughout the module please get in touch if you have anything to say on the content or the way we teach it. We’re very open to both positive and negative feedback — it helps to shape and improve the module. Similarly, if you’re having problems keeping up or don’t understand a particular concept, please let us know as soon as possible so we can help you as soon as possible.

## Module Description

This module will build on your work last year in TECH2015, as well as what you did in TECH1015 and develop your understanding of media presentation using the Internet. Through the course of this module you’ll develop a more nuanced approach that will consider the needs of different users consuming your media through a range of platforms.

You will build on your technical understanding of the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these languages you will investigate issues of layout, style, animation, and interactivity, all with a keen focus on the user and the user experience. You will also make use of existing online resources and data sources.

Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research into the software and practices we undertake. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.

[Contents](#tableofcontents)

## How the Module Works

This module is delivered through a weekly series of lectures and practical lab sessions. 

### Lecture Sessions

We will have a one-hour lecture each week. These will be used to discuss issues such as design and accessibility, as well as engage in collaborative practical tasks to help explain and demonstrate key concepts as we move through the module. 

### Practical Lab Sessions

The practical lab sessions will be an opportunity for you to practice your skills in producing interactive experiences on the web, with ongoing support from your lab tutor. 

### Learning Materials

The lecture sessions will be recorded and made available to you via DMU Replay for review within a few days of the lecture. These might provide helpful reminders.

In addition, we have a collection of short-form practical videos and explainers that step through key tasks and concepts when coding for the web. These will be linked to as they become appropriate, though you're more than welcome to browse the whole catalogue. 

In the labs, you'll be working through set tasks, with an opportunity for comment, help, and review by your lab tutor. 

You should also make use of the reading list, linked from the Blackboard Shell, to find sources of information that could help you master particular concepts along the way.

## Academic Offences and Bad Academic Practice 

These include but are not limited to plagiarism, cheating, contract cheating, exam cheating, collusion, copying work and reuse of your own work, poor referencing or the passing off of somebody else's ideas as your own (as defined in Chapter 4 of the General Regulations and Procedures Affecting Students). For modules containing a research element, please note that the conduct of research without an ethics review (if applicable) will be treated as an academic offence.

If you are in any doubt about what constitutes an academic offence or bad academic practice, you must check with your tutor.

If you are suspected of committing an academic offence you will be called to a meeting with an Academic Practice Officer (APO). APOs are based within in each faculty and it is their role to advise on how to prevent bad academic practice and academic offences and to deal with serious cases.

For further information please see the below webpages:

## Assessment

You will be assessed continuously through the module with formal feedback given at two key points through the year as well as informally in labs. The full details of coursework 1 and 2 follows this brief overview.

### Coursework 1

**Due Date:** 12pm (midday) on Friday 2nd December  
**Weighting:** 40% of your module mark  

Your first coursework will see you produce an individual piece of work. This will involve planning and designing a web-based interactive story. This should include wireframe sketches, final designs including navigation, mood board, content inventory, and interaction design (what changes, how and why). You also need to explain how you will prepare media types and text content for web delivery.

The full brief for Coursework 1 can be found here: <a href="https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader?TECH3015-CW1-Brief">https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader?TECH3015-CW1-Brief</a>

### Coursework 2

**Date Date:** 12pm (midday) on Tuesday 2nd May
**Weighting:** 60% of your module mark  

This coursework will see you using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6 to  produce the interactive story you designed for coursework 1.

The full brief for Coursework 2 can be found here: <a href="https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader?TECH3015-CW2-Brief">https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader?TECH3015-CW2-Brief</a>


### Some notes on assessment submissions

All written submissions (i.e. reports and documentation) should be submitted through Turnitin. You will find a link to submit your report through the Assessment section on Blackboard.

You will be required to create a logical folder structure on your public server to which you will upload your practical work for marking. Follow the instructions for structure and naming exactly, and don’t put anything there that shouldn’t be marked. If your tutor is in any doubt as to where your work is, it may not get marked.

Make sure the names of all files on your public server are _lower-case only_, with letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens - no spaces, no slashes!

If you are unsure about any details of an assessment, ask your lab tutor.

To reiterate:

- **All written work through Turnitin**
- **All practical work uploaded to your public server space**

[Contents](#tableofcontents)

## CW2 Marking Criteria

### Website

60% of the coursework mark

- [Content](#content)
- [Style](#style)
- [Technical Skills](#technicalskills)

### Documentation

40% of the coursework mark (1000-1500 words, with separate references and appendices not included in the word count)

- [Design Process](#designprocess)
- [Production](#production)
- [Evaluation](#evaluation)

### Website (60% of CW 2)

In semester 1 you designed and prototyped a modern web app or website. For this coursework you will create a responsive website—based on your work so far—using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

First, decide on modifications to the design as a result of feedback from your ‘testers’ and tutor. You can then focus on developing your web coding skills to make your planned design come to life.

If you decide to change your design or topic, explain why and how in the report.

### Report (40% of CW 2)

The report must document your updated design (if modified), explain your media preparation and knowledge of code, and make a critical evaluation of your finished project—what worked, what could be improved, explanations of decisions you made along the way, and how you might want to take the work further in future.

Make notes during the process of creating your website, so you can simply edit these before you submit the report rather than trying to remember your process retrospectively.

If you don't want to use your design or topic from Coursework 1, explain how and why you have readjusted your plans.

### Key points to consider:

- Examine [CW2 marking criteria](#cw2markingcriteria) closely. A good mark for Coursework 1 doesn't automatically translate to a website that meets the criteria for coursework 2 - you may need to adapt your design or prototype
- Don't skimp on **user testing** - this is critically important and **will** get you a better mark
- [validate your HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) (this is crucial) and at least run your [CSS through a validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), and [check for accessibility issues](https://wave.webaim.org/) (although these can be advisory) and briefly document this process
- **Reference any content** that’s not yours (images, music, sounds, online tutorial code not included in the learning materials etc.) e.g. in a list or appendix in the documentation (note: Google or other search engines themselves are _not_ primary sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may effect your grade.
- **Prepare your media**: content such as audio interviews, videos, images will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. Prepare media for quick download and/or streaming on the web, and demonstrate your knowledge of this requirement. Other modules are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output, so you can speak to your relevant tutor about this.

### Where to Start?

- think about how your designs will translate into code, especially the main blocks of content
- [validate your HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) at each major stage and fix any errors early—don't allow any broken code!
- start a document to make notes about your process and decisions
- get a basic responsive and mobile-fist structure up and running that follows your design
- upload to GitHub as you go along and get some feedback from testers

### Deliverables

1. the website, in your GitHub repository
2. your critical report, in PDF format

### Commenting Your Code

You should add comments to your HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with explanations of what your code does. These comments will demonstrate your understanding of your code and the reasons you took the approaches you did.

[Contents](#tableofcontents)

### Content

Your website content should be fully functional and robust (valid HTML, no missing images, JavaScript errors, etc.). This includes all text, graphics, images and any audio/video. You should use the correct HTML5 code to display these and ensure you have prepared your media for the web.

- HTML5 markup uses semantic tags appropriately
- Text content has semantic structure e.g. headings, lists
- Careful selection, preparation and editing of video and/or audio
- Awareness of loading speed and disk space e.g. no huge images
- Your own original content is credited and any third-party content referenced (media from a single source can have just a single general credit/reference)

[Back to CW2 Marking Criteria](#cw2markingcriteria)

### Style

Your website should appeal to your intended audience and be consistent with your mockups/designs. You should make efficient use of CSS in order to style and position elements for your site.

- Style and layout reflect/have evolved from design
- Coherent overall design (following PARC principles), colour and font choices
- Design and content matches the target audience
- Skilful use of CSS to style and arrange site elements
- No duplicate CSS, classes instead of IDs for selectors
- Well-ordered CSS: mobile-first followed by `min-width` breakpoints to be fully responsive at any screen width

[Back to CW2 Marking Criteria](#cw2markingcriteria)

### Technical Skills

Your web site should demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts you have learnt in this module.

- Evidence of your ability to choose and code current web markup, style and programming
- Awareness of usability/accessibility (semantic HTML5 tags, image “alt” attributes, other considerations)
- Use of CSS animations and transitions (subtle or otherwise!)
- No broken links or missing media, site is consistent across mobile and larger platforms
- Use of at least two of:
  _ Local database storage
  _ Third-party APIs
  _ CSS Animation
  _ JavaScript user interaction and/or functionality

[Back to CW2 Marking Criteria](#cw2markingcriteria)

## CW2 Documentation

**Weighting:** 40% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Word Count:** 1000-1500 words with images. References and appendices not included in word count.

Note that the for the purposes of marking, your code comments will be considered as part of your documentation, specifically under the production section. The PDF you submit through Turnitin should contain your Design Process and Evaluation. Your documentation will be marked against the following three criteria.

### Design Process

Refer back to your mock-ups from assignment 1 and discuss:

- what has changed and why
- what you think your main challenge(s) were
- what you consider to be the most important feature(s) of your design

This should be written in light of your own evaluation of your design from CW1, with your peer and tutor feedback.

[Back to CW2 Marking Criteria](#cw2markingcriteria)

### Production

Offer some insight into the development of your website through extensive code comments. All of your code should be commented at a basic level to describe functionality and logic. Where applicable, you should also discuss:

- What you were trying to achieve
- How you did this
- Why you chose a certain approach
- How successful the outcome was

[Back to CW2 Marking Criteria](#cw2markingcriteria)

### Evaluation

Address the following points:

- Evidence of code testing (e.g. all links work, media loads, the site is consistent across browsers) and the HTML has been validated.
- Evidence and a breakdown of structured user testing and feedback.
- Evaluate your work, with reference to testing where appropriate, and user feedback, describing:
  - Any limitations of your website
  - Any improvements you would make to the site and why
  - Any problems you encountered along the way, referencing any solutions you found or devised
