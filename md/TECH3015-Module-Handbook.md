## Welcome to Multimedia III

I hope you enjoy studying this module through your final year and find that you learn many valuable skills from it. It is a modern reality that many creative disciplines can be enhanced with at least a working knowledge of how the web works. An incredible amount of content is now delivered over the Internet, from short form videos to full blockbusters, from amateur audio clips to platinum albums, images, radio, applications and more. Whether you’re a videographer, sound engineer, animator or editor, an understanding of the web should be a key component of your skillset.

Throughout the module please get in touch if you have anything to say on the content or the way we teach it. We’re very open to both positive and negative feedback — it helps to shape and improve the module. Similarly, if you’re having problems keeping up or don’t understand a particular concept, please let us know as soon as possible so we can help you as soon as possible.

## Module Description

This module will build on your work last year in TECH2015, as well as what you did in TECH1015 and develop your understanding of media presentation using the Internet. Through the course of this module you’ll develop a more nuanced approach that will consider the needs of different users consuming your media through a range of platforms.

You will build on your technical understanding of the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these languages you will investigate issues of layout, style, animation, and interactivity, all with a keen focus on the user and the user experience. You will also make use of existing online resources and data sources.

Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research into the software and practices we undertake. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.

## How the module works

These are difficult and unprecedented times. You may have keen worries about your own health, or those you care for, or you may not. We wanted this module to be one which you can tackle in the way in which you feel most safe and comfortable.

### Practical Lab Sessions

In previous years, you would have a one hour lecture and a two hour lab session every week. However, we've changed this slightly.

The whole cohort have a single practical lab session together. This will alternate each week between face-to-face and online. If you would rather not attend any of the face-to-face sessions, that's fine. I'll have an online classroom open so that you can still pop in and ask questions, share code and so on.

The lab in week 1 will be face-to-face, and then alternate from there. I'll email you at the end of each week with a reminder of what we're doing the following Monday.

### Learning Materials

In past years, you'd walk into your lab session and we'd start off with your tutor giving a live demo at the front. You'd then work through a task that sees you learning whatever we're doing at that point. Ideally you'd finish before the end of the lab.

This year, things will be slightly different. There will be no live demo at the front of the room. Instead, we are producing a series of short explainers for each lab session. Each of these will discuss a particular 'thing', such as a HTML refresher for example, with both a video and a text version. There will then be a guided activity that will see you using those techniques. All of these will be available via Blackboard from the beginning of the week BEFORE the lab.

This means you can start on this at home really early. You can start on week 2 work as soon as you've finished your week 1 lab for example. You don't have to, but you can if you want, if that's what suits you. You might find you get to week 2 and it all made total sense and you don't need to go to the physical lab session. If that's the case, just check in with a tutor via email or pop online for a quick review.

### Lectures

As with all modules, lectures will be asynchronous through the whole module - this means they will be pre-recorded and made available the week before that for which they are intended. Please do watch these as they will communicate many of the practical techniques and technologies that you'll need to make use of for the lab work, and indeed, for your coursework.

### Recommended online resources

**NOTE:** learn to filter what you find and check the date as some resources (including W3Schools) contain outdated information. For HTML that could be (e.g.) `<div class="header">` instead of `<header>` and for JavaScript, using (e.g.) `var`, when `let` and `const` are current practice.

- **[stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com)**  
  Question and answer site perhaps used by every developer ever. If you put a web development question into Google, chances are the answer will come up here. Check the date of answers and ask your tutor if unsure—some answers are not the best solutions!
- **[w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com)**  
  Detailed resource with mini tutorials and a great reference section for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. NOTE: check with your tutor that any JavaScript examples you want to use are current good practice, as not all the code is up-to-date.
- **[css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com)**  
  Really great website with loads of posts on stying your webpages and sites, all very well-explained.
- **[codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com)** Free high-quality online courses, although only the following (on the three front-end web languages) are recommended for this module:
  - [Learn How to Build Websites](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites)
  - [Introduction to **HTML**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)
  - [Learn **CSS**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)
  - [Introduction to **JavaScript**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).
- **[learn.freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)**  
  A complete free front-end course, including responsive webapps.
- **[WatchAndCode.com: Practical Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)**  
  A well-taught course on JavaScript.
- **[Udacity.com: Front End Web Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011)**  
  The above Udacity course is recommended for this module.

## Plagiarism

DMU defines plagiarism as **“the deliberate attempt to gain advantage by presenting any work, data or concepts (including drafts and work in progress) that are not the student’s own as if they were”**. The University takes a very serious stance against copying other people’s work without giving the proper credit.

You can read more about plagiarism and other academic offences in [Chapter 4 of the student regulations](https://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/dmu-students/academic-support-office/student-regulations/chapter-4-17.18.pdf).

If you use somebody else’s work, either as research or directly, always attribute the author/artist/musician etc in the proper way. In this module we use the Harvard Referencing style. Directions on the use of the Harvard referencing system can be found through the [DMU library website](http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Images/Selfstudy/Harvard.pdf).

If you are found to of copied work without crediting the source you are likely to face a disciplinary panel and could see your mark reduced to 0, or worse in extreme cases.

If you have any questions regarding plagiarism and other academic practice offences, you can email the Leicester Media School's Academic Practice Officer: Helen Ackerley <hackerley@dmu.ac.uk>

## Assessment

You will be assessed continuously through the module with formal feedback given at two key points through the year as well as informally in labs. The full details of coursework 1 and 2 follows this brief overview.

### Coursework 1

**Date and time due: 12pm (midday) on Monday 21st December 2020**

Worth **40%** of the module total, your first coursework will see you produce an individual piece of work. This will involve planning and designing a responsive website, this should include wireframe sketches, final designs including navigation, mood board, content inventory, testing from card-sorting in the labs and interaction design (what changes, how and why). You also need to explain how you will prepare media types and text content for web delivery.

### Coursework 2

**Date and time due: 12pm (midday) on Tuesday 4th May 2021**

Worth **60%** of the module total, this coursework will tackle HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6 to have you produce the website or web application you designed for coursework 1.

### Some notes on assessment submissions

All written submissions (i.e. reports and documentation) should be submitted through Turnitin. You will find a link to submit your report through the Assessment section on Blackboard.

You will be required to create a logical folder structure on your public server to which you will upload your practical work for marking. Follow the instructions for structure and naming exactly, and don’t put anything there that shouldn’t be marked. If your tutor is in any doubt as to where your work is, it may not get marked.

Make sure the names of all files on your public server are _lower-case only_, with letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens - no spaces, no slashes!

If you are unsure about any details of an assessment, ask your lab tutor.

To reiterate:

- **All written work through Turnitin**
- **All practical work uploaded to your public server space**

If for any reason this is not forthcoming by the due date your module leader will let you know why and when it can be expected. The Associate Professor Student Experience (<a href='mailto:CEMstudentexperience@dmu.ac.uk'>CEMstudentexperience@dmu.ac.uk</a>) should be informed of any issues relating to the return of marked coursework and feedback.

Note that you should normally receive feedback on your coursework by no later than 20 University working days after the formal hand-in date, provided that you have met the submission deadline.

### Submitting your coursework

**When completed, you are required to submit your coursework as a PDF through the Turnitin link in the Assessments section of the TECH3015 Blackboard page** ([see deliverables below](#deliverables)).

If you need any support or advice on completing this coursework please visit the Student Matters tab on the Faculty of Technology Blackboard page.

**Late submission of coursework policy**  
Late submissions will be processed in accordance with current University regulations which state:

> “the time period during which a student may submit a piece of work late without authorisation and have the work capped at 40% [50% at PG level] if passed is 14 calendar days. Work submitted unauthorised more than 14 calendar days after the original submission date will receive a mark of 0%. These regulations apply to a student’s first attempt at coursework. Work submitted late without authorisation which constitutes reassessment of a previously failed piece of coursework will always receive a mark of 0%.”

**Academic Offences and Bad Academic Practices**  
These include plagiarism, cheating, collusion, copying work and reuse of your own work, poor referencing or the passing off of somebody else's ideas as your own. If you are in any doubt about what constitutes an academic offence or bad academic practice you must check with your tutor. Further information and details of how DSU can support you, if needed, is available from the Academic Support Office at these links:

- [Academic Offences](http://www.dmu.ac.uk/dmu-students/the-student-gateway/academic-support-office/academic-offences.aspx)
- [Bad Academic Practice](http://www.dmu.ac.uk/dmu-students/the-student-gateway/academic-support-office/bad-academic-practice.aspx)

[Contents](#table-of-contents)

### CW1 Overview

Worth **40%** of the module total, your first coursework will see you produce an individual piece of work. This will involve planning and designing a responsive website, this should include images of wireframe sketches, final designs including navigation, mood board, content inventory, testing from card-sorting in the labs and interaction design (what changes, how and why). You also need to explain that you know how to prepare media types and text content for web delivery.

You are encouraged to seek feedback about your ongoing work from your lab tutor throughout the first semester.

This design and specification can form the basis of what you produce for coursework 2 (but does not have to be), so this is a great opportunity to get some thorough feedback before moving onto production for the second coursework.

[Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Where to Start?

Your first job is to decide what your website is going to be. Although you are going to carry this design forward into coursework 2, you can make changes between the two based on the feedback you’ll get, so don’t feel you have to commit to something that will satisfy CW2 right now.

However, there are a number of points that your plans should satisfy:

- uses or presents multimedia content
- uses animation in the user interface
- is accessible
- is mobile-first, then adapts to any screen size
- is valid HTML
- contains multiple pages/sections

If you’re stuck for an idea, you’ll find some [suggestions at the end of this brief](#example-website-ideas), so feel free to use one of them.

Once you know what your website is going to be all about you can start planning it all out:

- draw out some rough **pencil sketches** and more detailed **wireframes** (you can start on squared paper)
- collect **media content** (i.e. images, videos, audio, icons, fonts, etc.)
- start writing out any **text content** you need (in plain text)
- think about your **menu structure** (and possibly do some **card sorting** with some friends)
- experiment with different **colour schemes** and **fonts**
- using your wireframes as a guide, produce more **detailed designs** (use Photoshop or similar or an online service)
- get **feedback** from friends and others and keep a **record of their comments**
- make sure your media content is **resized**, **compressed**, etc. for the web
- experiment with **different layouts**, especially for different **screen sizes**

Finally, make sure you **read the marking criteria** and fill in any gaps that you haven't addressed already.

[Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Deliverables

Your final submission will be **a single compiled report of around 1200 words** plus imagery and references, as a PDF (you can generate a PDF from e.g. Word).

**The report should contain:**

- a brief outline explaining what your website is about
- wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- design sketches and finished design
- evidence of user feedback
- commentary and/or annotations on images
- critical analysis

It might also contain:

- site map
- content inventory
- user stories / user profiles
- moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.
- consistent formatted references

Your report will be submitted through Turnitin. If you do not submit through Turnitin, it will not be marked.

[Contents](#table-of-contents)

### CW1 Marking Criteria

There are five marking criteria, each worth an equal 20% of the total coursework mark for assignment 1.

- [Information Architecture](#information-architecture)
- [Responsiveness](#responsiveness)
- [Design and Interaction](#design-and-interaction)
- [Accessibility](#accessibility)
- [Critical Analysis](#critical-analysis)

This means that each deliverable might contribute to several or all of the marking criteria and vice-versa.

<!--
For example your wireframes might show:

- a clear difference in design for mobile and desktop sizes
- some critical thinking in your annotations and testing of different design options if you show some alternatives or earlier iterations
- how you plan to organise your content
- how you plan on addressing accessibility in your site
- showing how certain elements will change based on user input
-->

### Information Architecture

This is concerned with the organisation and structure of your content.

- every section/page is easily findable from any other section/page
- content follows logical groups and avoids cognitive overload
- suitable headings and subheadings, and lists, etc. where appropriate
- clear thinking about users, content and context
- consistent language (controlled vocabulary) throughout the site
- justification of design, regarding familiar mental models and assumptions the target audience may already have
- clear indication of current location in respect of whole website content ("you are here", breadcrumbs, highlight current menu item, etc.)

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

- site map
- content inventory
- wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- design sketches and finished design
- user stories / user profiles

[Back to CW1 Marking Criteria](#cw1-marking-criteria)

### Responsiveness

This is concerned with the degree to which to make sure your site adapts to the screen size it is being used on.

- awareness of mobile first design principles
- clear differences between mobile and desktop versions (and tablet version if needed)
- navigation and menus respond to changes in and are suitable for any screen width
- content layout adapts to any screen size
- mobile content takes account of readability (e.g. font size, heading length, button/link size)
- concealing complexity and simplifying content for mobile screen sizes

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

- wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- design sketches and finished design

[Back to CW1 Marking Criteria](#cw1-marking-criteria)

### Design and Interaction

This is concerned with your plans for user interaction with elements on your page (e.g. clicks, hovers, and scrolls). This may include transitions, animations, and transforms.

- adherence to PARC principles
- creative use of white space (no overcrowding, especially at desktop size)
- consistent margins and alignment of design elements
- legible fonts and colour choices
- visual design scales smoothly to larger screen sizes
- any interaction is appropriate to device type (e.g. no dependence on hover for mobile)
- consistent use of hover states
- creative use of interaction (e.g. dropdown menus, swiping, animations, scroll events, ...)

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

- moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.
- wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- design sketches and finished design

[Back to CW1 Marking Criteria](#cw1-marking-criteria)

### Accessibility

This is concerned with the degree to which you make sure your site is as accessible as possible to all.

- content inventory includes alt image attribute text
- planning for accessible media (e.g. video subtitles, full user controls)
- awareness of semantic structure
- main content is clearly distinct from rest of page
- clickable targets are large enough on mobile
- colour scheme has enough contrast
- text is readable and zoomable (especially on mobile)

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

- site map
- content inventory
- wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- design sketches and finished design
- user stories / user profiles
- moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.

Consider using the [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)](https://wave.webaim.org/)

[Back to CW1 Marking Criteria](#cw1-marking-criteria)

### Critical Analysis

This is concerned with your ability to critically evaluate your own skills, needs, and planning process.

- honest self-evaluation of your strengths and weaknesses so far
- clear grasp of skills you need to implement and build the actual website
- outline of any third-party involvement in your planning process (e.g. card sorting, feedback on wireframes and/or designs)
- clear and readable structure of overall document (headings, page numbers, image captions, etc.)
- back up any assertions (e.g. "most people use a smartphone these days") with specific references

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

- evidence of user feedback (e.g. card sorting, design feedback, ...)
- consistent reference formatting

[Back to CW1 Marking Criteria](#cw1-marking-criteria)

### Example website ideas

Here are a few examples of what you could do. You can use one of these ideas as a start point as it is, or simply for inspiration to get you going.

**A Single-Page Website**  
Multiple sections combine into a single long vertical-scrolling page. As the user scrolls down, new sections are introduced through a combination of background (colour, shape, image) and foreground (text, graphics) animations. A menu provides direct access to each section.

**Portfolio Website**  
A CV like website that lists achievements and showcases demos of your work.

**Online Gallery**  
A grid of thumbnails presents a range of artwork. Click on one and you can see it full size, alongside notes such as the artist, medium, date etc. The thumbnails in the grid are resizeable - when they're made larger, you get less in a row - they rearrange. The grid is filterable: the user selects to just show photography, everything else disappears and the grid rearranges.

**A Personalised Story**  
The user enters their name and other details on page 1, before being presented with a simple interactive story that incorporates these details. Animations mark the transition between scenes and the introduction of text and graphics within them.

If for any reason this is not forthcoming by the due date your module leader will let you know why and when it can be expected. The Associate Professor Student Experience (<a href='mailto:CEMstudentexperience@dmu.ac.uk'>CEMstudentexperience@dmu.ac.uk</a>) should be informed of any issues relating to the return of marked coursework and feedback.

Note that you should normally receive feedback on your coursework by no later than 20 University working days after the formal hand-in date, provided that you have met the submission deadline.

### CW2 Overview

The website and report together are worth **60%** of the overall module total. For the second coursework you will produce an individual website or web-based work.

You are encouraged to seek feedback about your ongoing work from your lab tutor throughout the second semester.

### Submitting your coursework

**When completed, you are required to submit your coursework as follows:**

- Your **report** as a PDF, through the Turnitin link in the Assessments section of the TECH3015 Blackboard pag ([see deliverables below](#deliverables))
- Your **website** should be in your GitHub repository—name the landing page 'index.html'. Your tutor should be added as a contributor on this repository.

**Late submission of coursework policy**  
Late submissions will be processed in accordance with current University regulations which state:

> “the time period during which a student may submit a piece of work late without authorisation and have the work capped at 40% [50% at PG level] if passed is 14 calendar days. Work submitted unauthorised more than 14 calendar days after the original submission date will receive a mark of 0%. These regulations apply to a student’s first attempt at coursework. Work submitted late without authorisation which constitutes reassessment of a previously failed piece of coursework will always receive a mark of 0%.”

**Academic Offences and Bad Academic Practices**  
These include plagiarism, cheating, collusion, copying work and reuse of your own work, poor referencing or the passing off of somebody else's ideas as your own. If you are in any doubt about what constitutes an academic offence or bad academic practice you must check with your tutor. Further information and details of how DSU can support you, if needed, is available from the Academic Support Office at these links:

- [Academic Offences](http://www.dmu.ac.uk/dmu-students/the-student-gateway/academic-support-office/academic-offences.aspx)

## CW2 Marking Criteria

### Website

60% of the coursework mark

- [Content](#content)
- [Style](#style)
- [Technical Skills](#technical-skills)

### Documentation

40% of the coursework mark (1000-1500 words, with separate references and appendices not included in the word count)

- [Design Process](#design-process)
- [Production](#production)
- [Evaluation](#evaluation)

### Website (60% of CW 2)

In semester 1 you designed and prototyped a modern web app or website. For this coursework you will create a responsive website—based on your work so far—using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

First, decide on modifications to the design as a result of feedback from your ‘testers’ and tutor. You can then focus on developing your web coding skills to make your planned design come to life.

If you decide to change your design or topic, explain why and how in the report.

### Report (40% of CW 2)

The report must document your updated design (if modified), explain your media preparation and knowledge of code, and make a critical evaluation of your finished project—what worked, what could be improved, explanations of decisions you made along the way, and how you might want to take the work further in future.

Make notes during the process of creating your website, so you can simply edit these before you submit the report rather than trying to remember your process retrospectively.

If you don't want to use your design or topic from Coursework 1, explain how and why you have readjusted your plans.

### Key points to consider:

- Examine [CW2 marking criteria](#cw2-marking-criteria) closely. A good mark for Coursework 1 doesn't automatically translate to a website that meets the criteria for coursework 2 - you may need to adapt your design or prototype
- Don't skimp on **user testing** - this is critically important and **will** get you a better mark
- [validate your HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) (this is crucial) and at least run your [CSS through a validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), and [check for accessibility issues](https://wave.webaim.org/) (although these can be advisory) and briefly document this process
- **Reference any content** that’s not yours (images, music, sounds, online tutorial code not included in the learning materials etc.) e.g. in a list or appendix in the documentation (note: Google or other search engines themselves are _not_ primary sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may effect your grade.
- **Prepare your media**: content such as audio interviews, videos, images will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. Prepare media for quick download and/or streaming on the web, and demonstrate your knowledge of this requirement. Other modules are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output, so you can speak to your relevant tutor about this.

### Where to Start?

- think about how your designs will translate into code, especially the main blocks of content
- [validate your HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) at each major stage and fix any errors early—don't allow any broken code!
- start a document to make notes about your process and decisions
- get a basic responsive and mobile-fist structure up and running that follows your design
- upload to GitHub as you go along and get some feedback from testers

### Deliverables

1. the website, in your GitHub repository
2. your critical report, in PDF format

### Commenting Your Code

You should add comments to your HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with explanations of what your code does. These comments will demonstrate your understanding of your code and the reasons you took the approaches you did.

[Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Content

Your website content should be fully functional and robust (valid HTML, no missing images, JavaScript errors, etc.). This includes all text, graphics, images and any audio/video. You should use the correct HTML5 code to display these and ensure you have prepared your media for the web.

- HTML5 markup uses semantic tags appropriately
- Text content has semantic structure e.g. headings, lists
- Careful selection, preparation and editing of video and/or audio
- Awareness of loading speed and disk space e.g. no huge images
- Your own original content is credited and any third-party content referenced (media from a single source can have just a single general credit/reference)

[Back to CW2 Marking Criteria](#cw2-marking-criteria)

### Style

Your website should appeal to your intended audience and be consistent with your mockups/designs. You should make efficient use of CSS in order to style and position elements for your site.

- Style and layout reflect/have evolved from design
- Coherent overall design (following PARC principles), colour and font choices
- Design and content matches the target audience
- Skilful use of CSS to style and arrange site elements
- No duplicate CSS, classes instead of IDs for selectors
- Well-ordered CSS: mobile-first followed by `min-width` breakpoints to be fully responsive at any screen width

[Back to CW2 Marking Criteria](#cw2-marking-criteria)

### Technical Skills

Your web site should demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts you have learnt in this module.

- Evidence of your ability to choose and code current web markup, style and programming
- Awareness of usability/accessibility (semantic HTML5 tags, image “alt” attributes, other considerations)
- Use of CSS animations and transitions (subtle or otherwise!)
- No broken links or missing media, site is consistent across mobile and larger platforms
- Use of at least two of:
  _ Local database storage
  _ Third-party APIs
  _ CSS Animation
  _ JavaScript user interaction and/or functionality

## CW2 Documentation

**Weighting:** 40% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Word Count:** 1000-1500 words with images. References and appendices not included in word count.

Note that the for the purposes of marking, your code comments will be considered as part of your documentation, specifically under the production section. The PDF you submit through Turnitin should contain your Design Process and Evaluation. Your documentation will be marked against the following three criteria.

### Design Process

Refer back to your mock-ups from assignment 1 and discuss:

- what has changed and why
- what you think your main challenge(s) were
- what you consider to be the most important feature(s) of your design

This should be written in light of your own evaluation of your design from CW1, with your peer and tutor feedback.

[Back to CW2 Marking Criteria](#cw2-marking-criteria)

### Production

Offer some insight into the development of your website through extensive code comments. All of your code should be commented at a basic level to describe functionality and logic. Where applicable, you should also discuss:

- What you were trying to achieve
- How you did this
- Why you chose a certain approach
- How successful the outcome was

[Back to CW2 Marking Criteria](#cw2-marking-criteria)

### Evaluation

Address the following points:

- Evidence of code testing (e.g. all links work, media loads, the site is consistent across browsers) and the HTML has been validated.
- Evidence and a breakdown of structured user testing and feedback.
- Evaluate your work, with reference to testing where appropriate, and user feedback, describing:
  - Any limitations of your website
  - Any improvements you would make to the site and why
  - Any problems you encountered along the way, referencing any solutions you found or devised
