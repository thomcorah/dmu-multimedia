## Welcome to Multimedia III

I hope you enjoy studying this module through your final year and find that you learn many valuable skills from it. It is a modern reality that many creative disciplines can be enhanced with at least a working knowledge of how the web works. An incredible amount of content is now delivered over the Internet, from short form videos to full blockbusters, from amateur audio clips to platinum albums, images, radio, applications and more. Whether you’re a videographer, sound engineer, animator or editor, an understanding of the web should be a key component of your skillset.

In this module we will use web technologies and combine them with creative storytelling to produce original interactive content for the web. Through this, you will expand your skills in creative coding, using the web as a platform for creative ideas. 

Throughout the module please get in touch if you have anything to say on the content or the way we teach it. We’re very open to both positive and negative feedback — it helps to shape and improve the module. Similarly, if you’re having problems keeping up or don’t understand a particular concept, please let us know as soon as possible so we can help you as soon as possible.

## Module Description

This module will build on your work last year in TECH2015, as well as what you did in TECH1015 and develop your understanding of media presentation using the Internet. Through the course of this module you’ll develop a more nuanced approach that will consider the needs of different users consuming your media through a range of platforms.

You will build on your technical understanding of the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these languages you will investigate issues of layout, style, animation, and interactivity, all with a keen focus on the user and the user experience. You will also make use of existing online resources and data sources.

Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research into the software and practices we undertake. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.

## How the Module Works

This module is delivered through a weekly series of lectures and practical lab sessions. 

### Lecture Sessions

We will have a one-hour lecture each week. These will be used to discuss issues such as design and accessibility, as well as engage in collaborative practical tasks to help explain and demonstrate key concepts as we move through the module. 

### Practical Lab Sessions

The practical lab sessions will be an opportunity for you to practice your skills in producing interactive experiences on the web, with ongoing support from your lab tutor. 

### Learning Materials

The lecture sessions will be recorded and made available to you via DMU Replay for review within a few days of the lecture. These might provide helpful reminders.

In addition, we have a collection of short-form practical videos and explainers that step through key tasks and concepts when coding for the web. These will be linked to as they become appropriate, though you're more than welcome to browse the whole catalogue. 

In the labs, you'll be working through set tasks, with an opportunity for comment, help, and review by your lab tutor. 

You should also make use of the reading list, linked from the Blackboard Shell, to find sources of information that could help you master particular concepts along the way.

## Key Topics

This module will develop your understanding and engagement with:

- Wireframing, prototyping and mobile-first planning
- Designing and developing for any device with Responsive Web Design (RWD)
- Scalable vector graphics (SVG) for the web

- General notices and announcements
- Lab activities and exercises
- Lecture slides and recordings
- Assessments
- Your assessment feedback

## Academic Offences and Bad Academic Practice 

These include but are not limited to plagiarism, cheating, contract cheating, exam cheating, collusion, copying work and reuse of your own work, poor referencing or the passing off of somebody else's ideas as your own (as defined in Chapter 4 of the General Regulations and Procedures Affecting Students). For modules containing a research element, please note that the conduct of research without an ethics review (if applicable) will be treated as an academic offence.

If you are in any doubt about what constitutes an academic offence or bad academic practice, you must check with your tutor.

If you are suspected of committing an academic offence you will be called to a meeting with an Academic Practice Officer (APO). APOs are based within in each faculty and it is their role to advise on how to prevent bad academic practice and academic offences and to deal with serious cases.

For further information please see the below webpages:

The current Academic Practice Officer (APO) for your faculty who you may contact for any advice on this matter is:

## Assessment

You will be assessed continuously through the module with formal feedback given at two key points through the year as well as informally in labs. The full details of coursework 1 and 2 follows this brief overview.

### Coursework 1

**Due Date:** 12pm (midday) on Friday 2nd December  
**Weighting:** 40% of your module mark  

Your first coursework will see you produce an individual piece of work. This will involve planning and designing a web-based interactive story. This should include wireframe sketches, final designs including navigation, mood board, content inventory, and interaction design (what changes, how and why). You also need to explain how you will prepare media types and text content for web delivery.

The full brief for Coursework 1 can be found here: <a href="https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader?TECH3015-CW1-Brief">https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader?TECH3015-CW1-Brief</a>

### Coursework 2

**Date Date:** 12pm (midday) on Tuesday 2nd May
**Weighting:** 60% of your module mark  

This coursework will see you using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6 to  produce the interactive story you designed for coursework 1.

The full brief for Coursework 2 can be found here: <a href="https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader?TECH3015-CW2-Brief">https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader?TECH3015-CW2-Brief</a>


### Some notes on assessment submissions

All written submissions (i.e. reports and documentation) should be submitted through Turnitin. You will find a link to submit your report through the Assessment section on Blackboard.

You will be required to create a logical folder structure on your public server to which you will upload your practical work for marking. Follow the instructions for structure and naming exactly, and don’t put anything there that shouldn’t be marked. If your tutor is in any doubt as to where your work is, it may not get marked.

Make sure the names of all files on your public server are _lower-case only_, with letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens - no spaces, no slashes!

If you are unsure about any details of an assessment, ask your lab tutor.

To reiterate:

- **All written work through Turnitin**
- **All practical work uploaded to your public server space**
