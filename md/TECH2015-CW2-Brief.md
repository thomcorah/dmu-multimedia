### Overview

In semester 1 you designed and prototyped a web-based interactive story. For this coursework you will go on to produce it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You will first make any modifications to the design that you think are necessary following feedback from your tutor and peers. You will then let loose your webdev skills in realising your dream design.

As well as your practical work, you will also submit a report documenting any changes to your designs and an evaluation of your finished project.

But what if you don't want to use your design from Coursework 1? That's fine, speak to your tutor about developing a proposal for a different idea.

Some key points to consider:

- Make sure to pay attention to the marking criteria. A good mark for Coursework 1 doesn't automatically translate to an interactive story that hits all the criteria for coursework 2 - you may need to adapt your design
- Don't skimp on the testing - this is critically important and **will** get you a better mark.
- Stick to your (updated) design. If you need to differ from it, make sure to discuss this in your report.

Any content that is not yours (images, music, sound effects, etc.) should be appropriately referenced at a minimum in a list in the documentation (note that Google, or other search engines are not sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may effect your grade. This does not prevent you from getting your colleagues or tutor to criticise early drafts of your work before it is handed in / published.

Any content you produce for your story such as an audio interview will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. For example, a video that is stored at a much larger size than it is displayed at would be a no no. You have other modules where you are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output. Speak to your tutor if you have any questions about this.

You are expected to heavily comment your HTML, CSS, and JS code. These comments should show an understanding of how the code functions, and discuss any alternative approaches that were discounted. For the purposes of marking, these comments will be included in the mark for documentation.

There are two main components to this coursework: the interactive story itself and the documentation. The story attracts 60% of the mark for this coursework, and the documentation 40%.

### Documentation.

**Weighting:** 40% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Word Count:** 1000 words, plus appropriate screenshots.

Your documentation should consist of the following components. The Overview of Designs and Evaluation should be submitted as a single document through Turnitin. Your production notes will be included as comments in your code.

#### Overview of Designs

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark

You should include your designs, whether updated or not. These should be accompanied by a commentary that addresses:

- what was strong about your design
- what has changed and why
- where you think your main challenge(s) might be - and a fallback plan
- what you consider to be the priority feature(s) of your design

This should be written in light of your own evaluation of your design from CW1, your peer feedback, and your tutor feedback.

If you are using a new design (i.e. not what your submitted for CW1) then you will not have tutor feedback, but you should still gather peer feedback informally in order to assess the design you are using.

#### Production

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark

Included as comments throughout your code, these should give a high degree of insight into the development of your interactive story. Your comments should document what your code does and why at every point. It would be useful to include any discussion of alternative approaches as appropriate. For example, if you considered a different style of menu, why have you gone with what you've got.

Your comments should demonstrate a thorough understanding of what your code does.

Your comments should clearly show where you have used code from elsewhere, including a link to the source of the code. As well as for directly copied code, this also applies to code that has resulted from you following a tutorial.

#### Evaluation

**Weighting:** 20% of the coursework mark

You should address the following points:

- Provide evidence of testing (e.g. all links work, media loads, the site is consistent across browsers, accessibility and performance metrics).
- Provide evidence and a breakdown of structured user testing and feedback.
- Evaluate your work, with reference to testing where appropriate, and user feedback, describing:  
   - Your achievements, refer back to the original aims, explain any changes to your original ideas and why or how they have happened.  
   - Any limitations of your interactive story  
   - Any improvements you would make to it and why  
   - Any problems you encountered along the way, with potential solutions where possible

Your Overview of Designs and Evaluation should be submitted as a single document through the Turnitin link on Blackboard no later than midday on the day of the deadline.

### Practical Work - The Interactive Story

**Weighting:** 60% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  

Your story should be accessible via your public server.

The story will be assessed on the following three points.

### Content

**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark  
Your content should be fit for purpose and appropriate. This includes all text, graphics, images, sounds, and videos. You should use the correct techniques for displaying these in modern web browsers and ensure that you are using disk space and bandwidth efficiently.

- Text content shows semantic structure e.g. headings, lists
- Careful selection, creation and editing of video and/or audio
- Awareness of loading speed and disk space e.g. no huge images
- Original content is credited and third-party content is referenced

### Style

**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark  
Your interactive story should appeal to your intended audience and be consistent with your storyboards / designs. You should make appropriate use of CSS in order to properly style and layout your story.

- Style and layout reflect/have evolved from design
- Coherent overall design, colour and font choices
- Design and content matches the target audience
- Skillful use of CSS to style and arrange site elements

### Technical Skills

**Weighting:** 30% of the coursework mark  
Your interactive story should contain a variety of appropriate techniques that demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts you have learnt in this module.

- Evidence of intelligent ability to choose and code current web development techniques
- Awareness of usability/accessibility (semantic HTML5 tags and image “alt” attributes)
- Use of CSS animations and transitions
- All links work, media loads, story is consistent across browsers
- Excellent use of at least two of:
  - JavaScript
  - CSS animations and transitions
  - SVG animation
  - Responsive design
