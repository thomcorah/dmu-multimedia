# What is an Interactive Story?

This lab will have you assessing an existing online story in small groups. You will then present what you've found to the group. This will help you to think critically about various aspects of interactive storytelling and the use of web technologies, a process that should help you when thinking about creating your own web-based interactive stories. 

## 1. Get into groups

An easy first step. Get into groups of 2 or 3. 

## 2. Find an interactive story online

It doesn't really matter what you use, as long as there's enough to it to be able to do a good presentation about it. If you look at the list of questions below this should give you an idea of what to look out for. It's probably also a good idea to find one that you both/all like.

Now, watch and interact with the story.

## 3. Note the following things about the story

We want to think critically about this story. Here are some things to address:  

- What is the premise of the story, provide a synopsis.
- How linear is the story, how much control over the sequence of action does the reader have
- What is the visual design like, how does this relate (if at all) to the subject
- What kind of animations are used
- How do elements on the screen interact with the mouse
- What media is used (text, graphics, images, audio, video) and how are they used
- What kind of web technologies or techniques might have been used to create some of these effects

This list is not exhaustive, nor must you answer every point on it. It's a framework to get you thinking about the story you're reading and how/why it might be made.  

## 4. Present your story

Give a 10 minute presentation about your story. Obviously this shouln't include showing the whole story, but do include screenshots. You might also include short screen recordings of pertinant animations as that may be easier than trying to explain them. 

These presentations are for the whole group to get a feel for the breadth of options available to you as creators of a web-based interactive story. They should be a start point for discussions, and will hopefully start to get you thinking creatively about what you can achieve with this medium.
