#Â Starting a Project

### 1. Create a folder, open it in your code editor.
Use the normal file explorer to create the folder. Open it in your code editor. This is usually File -> Open Folder.

### 2. Create a `css` folder, and create a `style.css` file inside it.
You can usually do this in your code editor. Right click your new project folder in the file view of your code editor and select New Folder. Give it a name. Don't forget the .css file extension on the new file.

### 3. Create your `html` file.
Right click your main project folder and select New File. Don't forget the .html file extension.

### 4. Fill it with the starting HTML
In your new html file, type `html` and select the appropriate shortcut. In VS Code for example, it'll come up with a little box from which you can select HTML 5.

### 5. Add the viewport meta tag to the `<head>` section:
If this isn't already included in your `<head>` section, here it is:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

### 6. Link the stylesheet in.
Use a `<link>` element in the `<head>` section. There's a short guide to inserting a stylesheet here: <https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader.html?linking-a-css-file-short.md>

### 7. Open your page in Chrome
Do so through the browser. Navigate to <https://my.tech.dmu.ac.uk/~pNumber> and substitute your own student number in.

### 8. Open the inspector and switch to responsive mode.
Right click anywhere in the Chrome window and select Inspect to open the developer tools. Then click the little logo that looks like a phone and a tablet to switch to responsive mode.
