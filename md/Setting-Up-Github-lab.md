## What and Why?

GitHub is an online service that allows you to store, edit and share your code. It keeps track of changes and lets others contribute, if you want them to. It also has a service that can present your web code as a website.

This makes it really useful for your multimedia work as you can upload your code, your tutors can see and edit it, and it can be viewed as a website.

## Sign Up

To sign up to GitHub, go to <https://github.com> and follow the sign up link.

For the username, use your P-Number, not your name. This will help to preserve anonymity when we mark your work. However, your P-Number alone isn't long enough, so put `DMU-` on the front of it. For example, `DMU-P2222222`.

Then use your DMU student email address and a good password.

You'll be asked to select a few options, and to verify your email address by clicking the button in an email they send you.

## Manage Files

Create a new repository. This is just another name for a place to store all your files around a single project. You might have a repository for all your lab work for example.

GitHub takes you to a page that gives you a few options for adding code. There's a link to upload a file. Click this.

Once you've got a file in there, you'll see the start of a list of your files, as well as a button to add more.

You can go into the file you just uploaded it and edit it in GitHub if you want, but note that this won't change the file on your computer. You'll need to download it from GitHub or copy and paste the new code for that.

## Add Collaborators

GitHub allows you to add collaborators to a project. These are other GitHub users who will then be able to make edits to your work.

You should add your tutor(s) to your projects so that we can help you out by editing your work and/or adding comments in your code.

To add a collaborator, go into the settings for your repository, and then select Manage Access. There is a button there to add collaborators. Click that, and then enter the username of your tutor. Done.

## Enable Pages

GitHub Pages is the service that creates a website from your code. You need to turn this on though. Go into the repository settings. In the Options section that you land in to start with, scroll down to the sub-section called GitHub Pages.

There is a dropdown to select a branch to use for Pages. Just select Master, and then click the save button.

Your code is now viewable as a website. The URL to get to it is

```
<your username>.GitHub.io/<repository name>
```

For example, this page is held in a repository called `dmu-multimedia`, managed under the username `thomcorah`. It can be found within the following URL

```
thomcorah.GitHub.io/dmu-multimedia
```
