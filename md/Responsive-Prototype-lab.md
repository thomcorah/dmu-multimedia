# Build a Responsive Prototype

The aim of this lab activity is to have you:
- familiarise yourself with a prototyping tool
- think about a design problem
- articulate your design choices

To do this, you will work in small groups to produce an interactive prototype of the first screen of an interactive story, according to the requirements given below. You will then present your design to the rest of the lab group. 

## The Requirements

You have been tasked with producing an interactive story that can be read from the point of view of one of four main characters. One of the first screens therefore is for the user to choose the character they want to progress with. 

This screen should:
- include a picture of each character
- provide a short bio of each character
- give the option to select one character

It can include anything else you think is relevant. 

Your final prototype should show the differences between the view on mobile and the view on desktop. 

## The Tools

You can use either Justinmind or Invision to do this. Here are some useful links for both:

You can use something else if you like, as long as everyone in the group is happy. 

## The Presentation

You will then present your design to the rest of the group next week. This is very informal, no slides needed. Just show your design and talk briefly about what you did and why.
