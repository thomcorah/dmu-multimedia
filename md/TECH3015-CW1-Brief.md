## Overview  

Worth **40%** of the module total, your first coursework will see you produce an interactive prototype of your web-based story. The documentation for this should include images of wireframe sketches, final designs including navigation, mood board, content inventory, and interaction design (what changes, how and why), as well as feedback from users on your prototype. You also need to explain that you know how to prepare media types and text content for web delivery.

You are encouraged to seek feedback about your ongoing work from your lab tutor throughout the first semester.

This design and specification can form the basis of what you produce for coursework 2 (but does not have to), so this is a great opportunity to get some thorough feedback before moving onto production for the second coursework.

[Contents](#tableofcontents)

### Where to Start?

Your first job is to decide what your story is going to be. Although you are going to carry this design forward into coursework 2, you can make changes between the two based on the feedback you’ll get, so don’t feel you have to commit to something that will satisfy CW2 right now.

However, there are a number of points that your plans should satisfy:

- uses or presents multimedia content
- uses animation in the user interface
- is accessible
- is mobile-first, then adapts to any screen size
- contains multiple pages/sections

If you’re stuck for an idea, you’ll find some [suggestions at the end of this brief](#examplewebsiteideas), so feel free to use one of them.

Once you know what your story is going to be all about you can start planning it all out:

- draw out some rough **pencil sketches** and more detailed **wireframes** (you can start on squared paper)
- collect **media content** (i.e. images, videos, audio, icons, fonts, etc.)
- start writing out any **text content** you need (in plain text)
- think about your **navigation** (and possibly do some testing with some friends)
- experiment with different **colour schemes** and **fonts**
- using your wireframes as a guide, produce more **detailed designs** (use Photoshop or similar or an online service)
- get **feedback** from friends and others and keep a **record of their comments**
- make sure your media content is **resized**, **compressed**, etc. for the web
- experiment with **different layouts**, especially for different **screen sizes**

Finally, make sure you **read the marking criteria** and fill in any gaps that you haven't addressed already.

### Deliverables

Your final submission will be **a single compiled report of around 1200 words** plus imagery and references, as a PDF (you can generate a PDF from e.g. Word), along with an online interactive prototype.

**The report should contain:**

- a brief outline explaining what your story is about
- wireframes (mobile, desktop)
- design sketches and finished design
- evidence of user feedback
- commentary and/or annotations on images
- critical analysis

It might also contain:

- navigation map
- content inventory
- user stories / user profiles
- moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.
- consistent formatted references

Your report will be submitted through Turnitin. If you do not submit through Turnitin, it will not be marked.

### CW1 Marking Criteria

There are five marking criteria, each worth an equal 20% of the total coursework mark for assignment 1.

- [Presentation](#presentation)
- [Responsiveness](#responsiveness)
- [Design and Interaction](#designandinteraction)
- [Accessibility](#accessibility)
- [Critical Analysis](#criticalanalysis)

This means that each deliverable might contribute to several or all of the marking criteria and vice-versa.

For example your wireframes might show:

- a clear difference in design for mobile and desktop sizes
- some critical thinking in your annotations and testing of different design options if you show some alternatives or earlier iterations
- how you plan to organise your content
- how you plan on addressing accessibility in your site
- showing how certain elements will change based on user input

### Presentation

TThis is concerned with the presentation of both your prototype and the report.

- Prototype matches the final designs
- Links and transitions in the prototype work and are correct
- The report is properly and consistently formatted
- All referencing is proper and complete
- All images and figures in the report are numbered and captioned
- The report is free from spelling and grammar issues

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

- site map
- wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- design sketches and finished design

[Back to CW1 Marking Criteria](#cw1markingcriteria)

### Responsiveness

This is concerned with the degree to which to make sure your site adapts to the screen size it is being used on.

- awareness of mobile first design principles
- clear differences between mobile and desktop versions (and tablet version if needed)
- navigation and menus respond to changes in and are suitable for any screen width
- content layout adapts to any screen size
- mobile content takes account of readability (e.g. font size, heading length, button/link size)
- concealing complexity and simplifying content for mobile screen sizes

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

- wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- design sketches and finished design

[Back to CW1 Marking Criteria](#cw1markingcriteria)

### Design and Interaction

This is concerned with your plans for user interaction with elements on your page (e.g. clicks, hovers, and scrolls). This may include transitions, animations, and transforms.

- adherence to PARC principles
- creative use of white space (no overcrowding, especially at desktop size)
- consistent margins and alignment of design elements
- legible fonts and colour choices
- visual design scales smoothly to larger screen sizes
- any interaction is appropriate to device type (e.g. no dependence on hover for mobile)
- consistent use of hover states
- creative use of interaction (e.g. dropdown menus, swiping, animations, scroll events, ...)

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

- moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.
- wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- design sketches and finished design

[Back to CW1 Marking Criteria](#cw1markingcriteria)

### Accessibility

This is concerned with the degree to which you make sure your site is as accessible as possible to all.

- content inventory includes alt image attribute text
- planning for accessible media (e.g. video subtitles, full user controls)
- awareness of semantic structure
- main content is clearly distinct from rest of page
- clickable targets are large enough on mobile
- colour scheme has enough contrast
- text is readable and zoomable (especially on mobile)

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

- site map
- content inventory
- wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- design sketches and finished design
- user stories / user profiles
- moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.

Consider using the [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)](https://wave.webaim.org/)

[Back to CW1 Marking Criteria](#cw1markingcriteria)

### Critical Analysis

This is concerned with your ability to critically evaluate your own skills, needs, and planning process.

- honest self-evaluation of your strengths and weaknesses so far
- clear grasp of skills you need to implement and build the actual website
- outline of any third-party involvement in your planning process (e.g. card sorting, feedback on wireframes and/or designs)
- clear and readable structure of overall document (headings, page numbers, image captions, etc.)
- back up any assertions (e.g. "most people use a smartphone these days") with specific references

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

- evidence of user feedback (e.g. card sorting, design feedback, ...)
- consistent reference formatting

[Back to CW1 Marking Criteria](#cw1markingcriteria)

### Example story

Here are a few examples of what you could do. You can use one of these ideas as a start point as it is, or simply for inspiration to get you going.

**A choose-your-own-adventure story**

Allow the reader to make choices through the course of the story that change the trajectory of the story. This will require careful planning of the options they will have along the way in order to try to avoid dead ends. 

**A story with interactive elements**

A linear story where some visual elements respond to interaction from the reader. For example, a simple children's story where a butterfly flaps its wings when tapped or clicked. 

**A murder mystery**

Similar to the choose-your-own-adventure structure, where the reader navigates their own path through the story, uncovering evidence as they do so. The conclusion sees them having to decide who they think did the deed.

**A documentary story**

You could tell a real life story, such as the history of a football club or a crime case. You could intersplice real footage into your design along the way.
